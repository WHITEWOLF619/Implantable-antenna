# Implantable-antenna
A project attempting to improve the efficiency of an implantable antenna while conforming to the safety guidelines of  SAR (specific absorption ratio) and SA (specific absorption) standards.

Implemented on HFSS software.

structure of the patch antenna ands its frequency plot (with resonant frequency of 2.4ghz).
